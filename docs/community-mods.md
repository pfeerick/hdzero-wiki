This page aims to document community mods for the HDZero goggles and system generally.

## HDZero Goggle Mods
- [Paul Kendall's mod](https://github.com/pkendall64/hdzero-goggle/wiki/Analog-Module-Backpack-Control) to allow the goggles control some aspects of rapidFIRE, Steadyview, Steadyview X, TBS Fusion or any other module that allows selecting 1 of 8 channels with the buttons on other goggles.
