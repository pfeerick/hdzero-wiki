##VTX Update Guide
The zip file for each VTX contains HDZERO_TX.bin. 
###Steps to Update VTX firmware
1. Format your microSD card (Choose FAT32 and Allocation Unit size to 
4096 bytes)
2. Power off your VRX if it is already on. 
3. Copy the HDZERO_TX.bin file from corresponding VTX zip file onto your microSD card, and 
insert the microSD card into the VRX module.
4. Connect one end of your Firmware Update Cable to the VRX and the other end to the VTX you want to update.
5. Make sure to connect the mini-HDMI cable to your VRX and to your goggles/screen to see the firmware update progress.
6. Power on the VRX module.
7. If you get the "Wait to Connect VTX" or "Check Cable..." message, make sure that you did  step 4 right.
8. If you get the "Firmware update failed" message, repeat the procedure from step 1. 
9. If you get the "Firmware update successful" message, you are set.
10. HDZERO_TX.bin file is automatically removed after a successful update.

**Handy Tip**: If you create an empty file named "DONOTREMOVE.txt" in the root directory of the microSD card, HDZERO_TX.bin will not be removed after each successful update. This is convenient when you update several VTXes in succession.

##VRX/Goggles Update Guide
###Steps to Update VTX firmware

1.  Disconnect the cable that connects the VTX to the VRX module (or to your glasses) if it is still connected.
2.  Unzip the contents of the appropriate zip file (starting with RX5.1 or ScoutHD) to your microSD card.
3.  Make sure to connect the mini-HDMI cable to your VRX and to your goggles/screen to see the firmware update progress.
4.  Turn on the VRX module, and wait for the "Success" message to be displayed.

The firmware will be automatically deleted from the microSD card after the update.

**Note**: Do not turn off your VRX module (or goggles) while the firmware update is still in progress. Make sure that the message "Update Completed" is displayed, otherwise the VRX/goggles will not boot up correctly.
