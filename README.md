# hdzero-wiki

This is the unofficial documentation Wiki for HDZero, based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).


## Live version

The live version of this documentation should be visible at https://pfeerick.github.io/hdzero-wiki/


## Working locally on the documentation

You will need to have Python 3 installed, and the `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` packages installed. You can install these via pip, or your favourite package manager. 

You should then be able to run `mkdocs serve` to start a local webserver, and then browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the documentation. The documentation will automatically update as you make changes to the markdown files.
